### Adding Two Numbers
Function: add_numbers(num1, num2)

Description: Adds two numbers provided by the user and returns their sum.

Usage:
Prompts the user to enter two numbers.
Converts the inputs to floats.
Calculates the sum using the add_numbers function.
Displays the result.

### Checking Even or Odd
Function: is_even(number)

Description: Checks if a given number is even. The program repeatedly prompts the user to enter a number until 0 is entered, at which point the program terminates.

Usage:
Defines a function to determine if a number is even.
Uses a loop to repeatedly request input from the user.
Breaks the loop when 0 is entered.
Prints "Even" or "Odd" based on the result from is_even.

### Reversing a String
Function: reverse(text)

Description: Reverses the input string. Ensures that the input contains only alphabetic characters.

Usage:
The reverse function returns the reversed version of the input string.
get_text_only ensures that only alphabetic input is accepted.
Displays both the original and reversed strings.

### Counting Vowels
Function: vowel_count(text)

Description: Counts the number of vowels in the provided text and displays the count. Ensures that the input contains only alphabetic characters.

Usage:
Defines a function to count vowels in a string.
Uses list comprehension to filter and count vowels.
Validates input to ensure only alphabetic characters are accepted.

### Calculating Factorial
Function: calculate_factorial(n)

Description: Computes the factorial of a non-negative integer n using recursion.

Usage:
Prompts the user to enter a number.
Computes the factorial using a recursive function.
Prints the result.

### Using Decorators
Function: apply_decorator(func)

Description: Demonstrates the use of decorators. apply_decorator decorates a function to add custom behavior before executing the function.

Usage:
Defines a decorator function decorator_func.
Applies the decorator to my_function.
Prints the result along with the decorator message.

### Sorting Tuples by Age
Function: sort_by_age(tuples_list)

Description: Sorts a list of tuples where each tuple contains a name and age. The list is sorted by age.

Usage:
Uses sorted with a lambda function as the key to sort tuples by age.
Prints the sorted list.

### Merging Dictionaries
Function: merge_dicts(dict1, dict2)

Description: Merges two dictionaries. If a key exists in both dictionaries, their values are summed.

Usage:
Merges two dictionaries by summing values for common keys.
Prints the merged dictionary.

### Car Class
Class: Car

Description: Defines a Car class with attributes for make, model, and year, and includes a method to display the car's information.

Usage:
Defines a Car class with an initializer and a method to display car information.
Creates an instance of Car and displays its information.
